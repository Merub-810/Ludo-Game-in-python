<h1>Abstract </h1>
<p>The Ludo Game project is composed in Python. This is a simple GUI based method board game which is really understandable. 
Speaking about the gameplay, all the playing policies are the same much like real time LUDO. This is a GUI based 2 player game computer vs 
player. All the game motions are to be done by hand by the player. On Computer side, all the action and decision made up the computer 
himself based on their integrated intelligence. The 2D GUI is designed using Tkinter python libraries.</p>
<h1>Game Play </h1>
<p>When the game is opened, start window appears that prompts the user to start the game clicking  on “Start” button. Then the game interface is displayed and the red is computer side and yellow in player side. The player must roll the die by clicking on the “Roll dice ”  button at right . Until the value is 6, no piece can be moved. Once it is 6, the same player gets another chance to roll and that value can be used to move the piece. Next, there is a computer turn and there is also a dice and “Roll dice” button for computer. By clicking on the specific number button on their box sides that corresponds to the specific piece Player and Computer move their pieces. If you press the wrong button a piece number that is inside the room a dialogue box appears that directs player.  When a player’s piece overlaps the other player piece, the latter piece is sent to home box and the former piece players gets an another chance to roll the dice. The one who ensures all the pieces get inside the center wins the game. As soon as the game is won, a dialog box appears showing who won the game.</p>
